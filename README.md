# GAN and CGAN latent vis
### Use following code to download the dataset.
In this study, I examine the relationship between the dimensionality of the random latent vector used to generate images with a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and the quality of the generated images, as measured by the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score. Our results show that increasing the dimensionality of the latent vector leads to the generation of higher-quality images, but that there may be an optimal point beyond which further increases have little effect. Our findings suggest that the FID score can be a useful measure of the quality of images generated by a CGAN and that the dimensionality of the latent vector plays a role in determining this quality. And also I find a way to evaluate information contained in a dataset.

``` {python}
!kaggle datasets download -d dqmonn/zalando-store-crawl -p datasets
!unzip datasets/zalando-store-crawl.zip -d datasets/
